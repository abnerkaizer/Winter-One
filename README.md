# Winter-One
Winter One SFFPC Case

## The New Cold Standard
Winter One was designed with the utmost care to deliver unprecedented cooling, whisper-quiet operation, and great hardware compatibility in a compact size.


## Small, Yet Mighty
At just 15.6 L, Winter One supports desktop-class components like dual 280 mm radiators, 3-slot graphics cards, and 70 mm CPU coolers.

### The Best Sandwich You'll Never Eat
Winter One uses the innovative Sandwich Layout, refined. We eliminated the central spine, improving airflow and freeing up internal volume for better flexibility.

### Flexibility At Your Fingertips
The frameless architecture of Winter One maximizes the interior volume. With ample room to route tubing, mount a pump, attach a drive cage, and add fans or radiators, you can build your dream system.

##Engineered to Perform
Thousands of hours of design and computational fluid dynamics have gone into crafting airflow through Winter One. Hello science, goodbye thermal throttling.
